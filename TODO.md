## Code Cleanup
- share config with work setup
- get everything reasonable in github
- get rofi and i3 specific config into user config space
- clean up the rofi config to work like i3 one
- one day try to make a konsole configurator in typed nix
- things like polybar script should have a nice package / fn other things can ref

## Features

## Completed
- Lock screen stuck verifying...
- polybar not showing volume first try
- gruvbox greeter + decrease font
- white cursor ( cant figure out why its changing sizes )
- because GTK based apps didn't see the new size...
- get konsole hermetic
- greeter cleanup
- gtk theme ( nothing can really use it, rofi, polybar, and nix all have different configs. konsole doesn't even seem to be configurable from nix )
- polybar start on startup
- set up redshift / flux.io
- media keys
- file explorer at least?
- good names for terminals
- set xset noblank on startup
- some music playing tray in the polybar
- polybar
- change rofi window width
- finalize screen saver / dpms settings
- floating_maximum_size -- not possible, people think tiling WM is at odds with setting a max size.
- white mouse -- didn't do, not worth GTK, etc. all the hassle
- gaps
- finalize the background of everything
- compositor
