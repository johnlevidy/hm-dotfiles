1. If picom is running when the screen locks, it tries to make it transparent
  - mark-ovre solves this issue, and picom renders the lock screen over everything
2. Picom may be related to the "stuck on verifying" issue / where we get stuck with some blank-ish screen where input is still registered but nothing is showing up. Here we probably have to systemctl stop --user picom.service and reenable later
3. Another knob we have to pull is the i3lock --composite flag. This seems to independently handle the drawing issues, but even the owners of hte project dont seem enthusiastic about using it.
4. When I run with neither, sometimes polybar hangs above the lock screen



What are the known problems?

1. Transparent
  - solved by mark-ovredir-focused alone
  - solved by --composite alone
  - Solved by both together
  - Screen rez change alone doesn't work
  - solved by turning off picom
2. Polybar sticking
  - Screen rez seems to *cause* it
  - mark-ovre does not fix it
  - --composite flag fixes it
  - solved by both
  - solved by turning off picom
3. Coming out of monitor turnoff
  - 120hz fully broken, rarely get it back
  - 60hz comes back sometimes, often just going to TY and back
  - 3840x1080 always comes back
4. "Verifying..."
  - hypothesized that disabling picom fixes it

What are the known knobs?

1. Changing screen resolution down before locking.
2. setting mark-ovredir-focused = true in picom
3. turning off picom entirely
4. --composite flag
5. set dpi?
