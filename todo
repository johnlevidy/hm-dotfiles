- some music playing tray in the polybar
- good names for terminals

Completed
# polybar
# change rofi window width
# finalize screen saver / dpms settings
# floating_maximum_size -- not possible, people think tiling WM is at odds with setting a max size.
# white mouse -- didn't do, not worth GTK, etc. all the hassle
# gaps
# - finalize the background of everything
# - compositor
